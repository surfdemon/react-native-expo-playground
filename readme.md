This is a test / practice app just to help me learn React Native using Expo

Ideas for app 

[*] App wide menu for changing screens 

[*] Screen for Basic Calculator 

[*] Setup testing so that I can learn testing in react native and setup tests

[*] Setup test coverage report

[*] Setup tests for calculator screen 

[] Work out logger - To let you log your work out and view your previous workouts 

[] Intermittent Fasting Tracker - To let you track when you last had something to eat and how long has passed. Also 
let you see how long you fasted for in the past. 

[] Data to be stored on something like FireBase 

[] Ability to login to the app 

[] Pomodoro Timer
