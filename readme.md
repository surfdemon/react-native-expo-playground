This is a test / practice app just to help me learn React Native

Ideas for app 
[*] App wide menu for changing screens 
[*] Screen for Basic Calculator 
[] Work out logger - To let you log your work out and view your previous workouts 
[] Intermittent Fasting Tracker - To let you track when you last had something to eat and how long has passed. Also let you see how long you fasted for in the past. 
[] Data to be stored on something like FireBase 
[] Ability to login to the app 
[] Pomodoro Timer 
[]
